dupenet MVP — Progress Overview
================================

PHASE 1: BLOB UTILITY (Layer A)
--------------------------------

## Step 1 — File Layer + Gateway + HTTP Origin

[x] Canonical serialization          deterministic CBOR, sorted keys (packages/physics)
[x] CID computation                  SHA256-based content addressing
[x] Chunker                          256KiB blocks, reassembly
[x] Merkle tree                      binary merkle, odd-leaf promotion
[x] FileManifestV1 schema            TypeBox schema (chunk_size, size, blocks[], merkle_root)
[x] AssetRootV1 schema               TypeBox schema (kind, original, variants, meta)
[x] PricingV1 schema                 min_request_sats, sats_per_gb, burst
[x] Block storage backend            filesystem: {base}/{h[0:2]}/{h[2:4]}/{hash}
[x] PUT /block/:cid                  SHA256 verified on receive, rejects mismatches
[x] GET /block/:cid                  serves bytes; L402-gated when LND configured, free in dev mode
[x] PUT /file/:root                  validates file_root = SHA256(canonical(manifest)), checks all blocks exist
[x] GET /file/:root                  returns manifest (in-memory Map)
[x] PUT /asset/:root                 validates asset_root = SHA256(canonical(AssetRoot)), checks file exists
[x] GET /asset/:root                 returns asset (in-memory Map)
[x] HEAD /asset/:root                returns size, kind, mime headers
[x] GET /pricing                     returns PricingV1
[x] GET /health                      gateway health check
[x] Physics unit tests               canonical, cid, chunker, merkle, reward (5 suites, vitest)
[x] Gateway integration test          PUT /block xN -> PUT /file -> PUT /asset -> GET -> reassemble -> verify (7 tests)
[ ] EXIF/metadata stripping           strip before hashing (mentioned in spec, not implemented)
[ ] Runtime schema validation         TypeBox schemas defined but Value.Check not called on ingest

## Step 2 — L402 Paid Fetch + Receipt Minting

[x] Mint service structure            POST /sign, GET /pubkey, GET /health (apps/mint)
[x] Ed25519 keypair load              loads from MINT_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX env var
[x] Receipt token format              Sign("R2" || host || epoch || block_cid || response_hash || price || payment_hash)
[x] LND service in docker compose     lnd v0.18.0-beta, regtest mode in compose-founder.yml
[x] LND config fields                 LND_HOST, LND_MACAROON_PATH, LND_TLS_CERT_PATH in gateway + mint config
[x] LND client package                packages/lnd-client: LndClient interface, REST impl, MockLndClient for tests
[x] L402 challenge-response           GET /block returns 402 + invoice -> pay with preimage -> bytes + receipt_token
[x] Invoice store                     in-memory TTL map (payment_hash -> {cid, price, host, epoch, expiry})
[x] Invoice generation                gateway creates invoice via LndClient.createInvoice()
[x] Mint settlement check             mint calls LndClient.lookupInvoice(), verifies SETTLED + amount >= price
[x] Mint HTTP client                  gateway calls POST /sign on mint, receives receipt_token
[x] min_request_sats enforcement      price = min_request_sats used for all block fetches
[x] L402 integration tests            8 tests: 402 challenge, paid fetch, invalid/unknown/mismatch/single-use (mock LND)
[x] Client PoW receipt minting        minePoW(), buildChallengeRaw/ClientSigPayload/TokenPayload in physics
[ ] Block selection (anti-special)    PRF(epoch_seed || file_root || client) mod num_blocks — not implemented

## Step 3 — Node Kit + Host Registration

[x] compose-founder.yml               gateway, mint, coordinator, postgres, lnd, caddy (all with healthchecks)
[x] compose-nodekit.yml               gateway, node-agent, caddy
[x] Coordinator structure             Hono server with routes, event log, materialized views
[x] POST /host/register               registers host (stub stake verification)
[x] GET /directory                     returns host list from in-memory Map
[~] Node-agent basic structure         polls coordinator, announces, mirrors (mostly stubs)
[~] Mirror agent                       mirrorCid() implemented, findProfitableTargets() returns []
[~] Directory announcement             announceHost() works, announceServe() is TODO
[ ] Stake locking via LND              TODO: verify stake payment
[ ] Availability score tracking        formula in physics, not wired to coordinator
[ ] Status lifecycle                   PENDING -> TRUSTED -> DEGRADED -> INACTIVE not enforced
[ ] Health check responder             no spot-check endpoint in node-agent
[ ] CID selection agent                bounty watcher stub, no real bounty feed query

## Step 4 — Receipt Verification SDK

[x] VerifyReceiptV2 function           packages/receipt-sdk, full verification logic
[x] Ed25519 verify                     Web Crypto API, zero dependencies
[x] PoW hash check                     H(challenge || nonce) < TARGET validation
[x] Client signature check             Ed25519 sig over receipt payload
[x] Zero external dependencies         only crypto.subtle
[x] Test vectors                       valid e2e receipt (construct -> verify), invalid hex/PoW/token, wrong mint key (7 tests)

## Step 5 — Pin Contracts

[x] PinContractV1 schema               TypeBox schema (physics) + Prisma model
[ ] POST /pin                           stub: returns {ok: true, message: "stub"}
[ ] GET /pin/:id                        returns 404 not_implemented
[ ] pin_cancel                          not implemented
[ ] Drain rate enforcement              budget_sats / duration_epochs — not wired
[ ] Budget management                   no top-up or debit logic
[ ] Lifecycle transitions               ACTIVE -> EXHAUSTED/CANCELLED not enforced
[ ] min_copies enforcement              not implemented
[ ] Epoch proof bundle                  filtered EpochSummary for pinned asset — not implemented

COORDINATOR — PERSISTENCE + AGGREGATION
-----------------------------------------

[x] Prisma schema                      Event, BountyPool, Host, HostServe, EpochSummaryRecord, PinContract
[x] Prisma client generated            in Dockerfile (npx prisma generate)
[x] POST /tip                          credits bounty pool (in-memory Map, stub sig verification)
[x] GET /bounty/:cid                   reads from in-memory Map
[x] Event log writer                   in-memory array (not persisted)
[x] Bounty pool view                   in-memory Map
[x] Host registry view                 in-memory Map
[x] Epoch math                         packages/physics: epoch length 4h, current epoch, epoch boundaries
[x] Reward formulas                    cidEpochCap, computeHostScore, distributeRewards (physics)
[x] EpochSummary schema                defined in physics
[x] Coordinator -> Postgres             bounty-pool, host-registry, event-log all use PrismaClient (tsc clean)
[x] Event log persistence               append-only Postgres via prisma.event.create
[x] POST /receipt/submit                validates via receipt-sdk, checks epoch range + replay, stores in Prisma
[x] Receipt validation pipeline         verifyReceiptV2 checks client_sig, PoW, receipt_token against mint pubkeys
[ ] Epoch boundary trigger              no cron/scheduler
[ ] Payout execution                    distributeRewards() exists but not called anywhere
[ ] Bounty drain                        EPOCH_REWARD_PCT drain per epoch — not implemented
[ ] Aggregator fee                      3% deduction — not implemented
[ ] Signature verification on events    tip.sig and host registration sig are stubs

INTEGRATION / E2E
------------------

[x] Gateway round-trip test             upload multi-block file, retrieve by asset_root, verify SHA256 (7 tests)
[x] L402 flow test                      402 -> pay invoice -> receive block + receipt_token (8 tests, mock LND)
[ ] Docker E2E                          compose up -> upload -> tip -> host mirrors -> L402 fetch -> receipt -> payout
[x] Receipt round-trip test             construct valid receipt (PoW + mint sig + client sig) -> verifyReceiptV2 passes

SPRINT ORDER (recommended)
---------------------------

1. Gateway integration tests            DONE (7 tests pass)
2. L402 + mint settlement               DONE (8 tests pass, mock LND; Docker E2E with real LND in sprint 6)
3. Coordinator -> Postgres              DONE (tsc clean; requires `prisma db push` + Postgres to run)
4a. Receipt submission + validation     DONE (receipt-sdk e2e test passes; coordinator handler typechecks)
4b. Epoch aggregation + payout          requires: 4a. exit: epoch boundary triggers payout, bounty drains
5. Pin contracts lifecycle              requires: 4b. exit: create pin, drain rate enforced, cancel returns budget
6. Docker E2E                           requires: all above. exit: full compose flow works end-to-end
