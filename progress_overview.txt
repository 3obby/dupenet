================================

PHASE 1: BLOB UTILITY (Layer A)
--------------------------------

## Step 1 — File Layer + Gateway + HTTP Origin

[x] Canonical serialization          deterministic CBOR, sorted keys (packages/physics)
[x] CID computation                  SHA256-based content addressing
[x] Chunker                          256KiB blocks, reassembly
[x] Merkle tree                      binary merkle, odd-leaf promotion
[x] FileManifestV1 schema            TypeBox schema (chunk_size, size, blocks[], merkle_root)
[x] AssetRootV1 schema               TypeBox schema (kind, original, variants, meta)
[x] PricingV1 schema                 min_request_sats, sats_per_gb, burst
[x] Block storage backend            filesystem: {base}/{h[0:2]}/{h[2:4]}/{hash}
[x] PUT /block/:cid                  SHA256 verified on receive, rejects mismatches
[x] GET /block/:cid                  serves bytes; L402-gated when LND configured, free in dev mode
[x] PUT /file/:root                  validates file_root = SHA256(canonical(manifest)), checks all blocks exist
[x] GET /file/:root                  returns manifest (in-memory Map)
[x] PUT /asset/:root                 validates asset_root = SHA256(canonical(AssetRoot)), checks file exists
[x] GET /asset/:root                 returns asset (in-memory Map)
[x] HEAD /asset/:root                returns size, kind, mime headers
[x] GET /pricing                     returns PricingV1
[x] GET /health                      gateway health check
[x] Physics unit tests               canonical, cid, chunker, merkle, reward, epoch-aggregation, availability, block-selection, event-signature (9 suites, vitest)
[x] Gateway integration test          PUT /block xN -> PUT /file -> PUT /asset -> GET -> reassemble -> verify (7 tests)
[ ] EXIF/metadata stripping           strip before hashing (mentioned in spec, not implemented)
[ ] Runtime schema validation         TypeBox schemas defined but Value.Check not called on ingest

## Step 2 — L402 Paid Fetch + Receipt Minting

[x] Mint service structure            POST /sign, GET /pubkey, GET /health (apps/mint)
[x] Ed25519 keypair load              loads from MINT_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX env var
[x] Receipt token format              Sign("R2" || host || epoch || block_cid || response_hash || price || payment_hash)
[x] LND service in docker compose     lnd v0.18.5-beta + bitcoind regtest, 2-node (alice+bob) in compose-founder.yml
[x] LND config fields                 LND_HOST, LND_MACAROON_PATH, LND_TLS_CERT_PATH in gateway + mint config
[x] LND client package                packages/lnd-client: LndClient interface, REST impl, MockLndClient for tests
[x] L402 challenge-response           GET /block returns 402 + invoice -> pay with preimage -> bytes + receipt_token
[x] Invoice store                     in-memory TTL map (payment_hash -> {cid, price, host, epoch, expiry})
[x] Invoice generation                gateway creates invoice via LndClient.createInvoice()
[x] Mint settlement check             mint calls LndClient.lookupInvoice(), verifies SETTLED + amount >= price
[x] Mint HTTP client                  gateway calls POST /sign on mint, receives receipt_token
[x] min_request_sats enforcement      price = min_request_sats used for all block fetches
[x] L402 integration tests            8 tests: 402 challenge, paid fetch, invalid/unknown/mismatch/single-use (mock LND)
[x] Client PoW receipt minting        minePoW(), buildChallengeRaw/ClientSigPayload/TokenPayload in physics
[x] Block selection (anti-special)    selectBlockIndex(), selectBlock(), verifyBlockSelection() in physics (SHA256 PRF)

## Step 3 — Node Kit + Host Registration

[x] compose-founder.yml               gateway, mint, coordinator, postgres, lnd, caddy (all with healthchecks)
[x] compose-nodekit.yml               gateway, node-agent, caddy
[x] Coordinator structure             Hono server with routes, event log, materialized views
[x] POST /host/register               registers host (stub stake verification)
[x] GET /directory                     returns host list from in-memory Map
[x] Node-agent poll loop                discover profitable CIDs → mirror from source → announce serve (complete)
[x] Mirror agent                       findProfitableTargets() queries GET /bounty/feed; mirrorCid() fetches + pushes
[x] Directory announcement             announceHost() signed registration; announceServe() signed HostServe
[x] Availability score tracking        computeAvailabilityScore() in physics + updateAllScores() in coordinator
[x] Status lifecycle                   PENDING->TRUSTED (score>=0.6), TRUSTED->DEGRADED (score<0.6), ->INACTIVE (score==0)
[x] Spot-check responder              GET /spot-check/:cid on gateway (verifies hash, no L402, no bytes)
[x] Spot-check runner                 spotCheckHost(), runAllChecks() in coordinator (injectable fetcher)
[x] SpotCheck Prisma model            hostPubkey, cid, epoch, passed, latencyMs, error
[x] POST /hosts/check                 triggers spot-checks for all active hosts, updates scores
[x] GET /hosts/:pubkey/checks         returns check history + availability score + recommended status
[x] Availability tests                9 physics + 12 coordinator tests (scoring, transitions, spot-check runner)
[ ] Stake locking via LND              TODO: verify stake payment
[x] CID selection agent                queries GET /bounty/feed, filters by minBounty, mirrors top profitability CIDs

## Step 4 — Receipt Verification SDK

[x] VerifyReceiptV2 function           packages/receipt-sdk, full verification logic
[x] Ed25519 verify                     Web Crypto API, zero dependencies
[x] PoW hash check                     H(challenge || nonce) < TARGET validation
[x] Client signature check             Ed25519 sig over receipt payload
[x] Zero external dependencies         only crypto.subtle
[x] Test vectors                       valid e2e receipt (construct -> verify), invalid hex/PoW/token, wrong mint key (7 tests)

## Step 5 — Pin Contracts

[x] PinContractV1 schema               TypeBox schema (physics) + Prisma model
[x] POST /pin                           creates pin, computes drain_rate, credits bounty pool, logs event
[x] GET /pin/:id                        returns status, remaining budget, active hosts, copies_met, epoch proofs
[x] POST /pin/:id/cancel               returns remaining budget minus 5% fee, status -> CANCELLED
[x] Drain rate enforcement              drainPinBudgets() deducts min(actualDrain, drainRate) per epoch
[x] Budget management                   creditBountyDirect (no protocol fee); debitPayout on cancel refund
[x] Lifecycle transitions               ACTIVE -> EXHAUSTED (when remainingBudget=0); ACTIVE -> CANCELLED (on cancel)
[x] min_copies check                    getPinStatus compares active hosts vs min_copies, returns copies_met
[x] Epoch proof bundle                  getPinStatus returns recent EpochSummaryRecords for pinned asset (last 6 epochs)
[x] Pin contract tests                  22 tests: validation, create, status, cancel, drain rate, exhaustion
[x] Pin ID deterministic                SHA256(canonical(pin content)) — duplicate detection via unique constraint

COORDINATOR — PERSISTENCE + AGGREGATION
-----------------------------------------

[x] Prisma schema                      Event, BountyPool, Host, HostServe, EpochSummaryRecord, PinContract
[x] Prisma client generated            in Dockerfile (npx prisma generate)
[x] POST /tip                          credits bounty pool (in-memory Map, stub sig verification)
[x] GET /bounty/:cid                   reads from in-memory Map
[x] Event log writer                   in-memory array (not persisted)
[x] Bounty pool view                   in-memory Map
[x] Host registry view                 in-memory Map
[x] Epoch math                         packages/physics: epoch length 4h, current epoch, epoch boundaries
[x] Reward formulas                    cidEpochCap, computeHostScore, distributeRewards (physics)
[x] EpochSummary schema                defined in physics
[x] Coordinator -> Postgres             bounty-pool, host-registry, event-log all use PrismaClient (tsc clean)
[x] Event log persistence               append-only Postgres via prisma.event.create
[x] POST /receipt/submit                validates via receipt-sdk, checks epoch range + replay, stores in Prisma
[x] Receipt validation pipeline         verifyReceiptV2 checks client_sig, PoW, receipt_token against mint pubkeys
[x] Epoch aggregation (physics)         aggregateReceipts(), isPayoutEligible() — pure receipt grouping + 5/3 threshold
[x] Epoch settlement (coordinator)      settleEpoch() — aggregate receipts, compute payouts, drain bounty, persist EpochSummary
[x] POST /epoch/settle                  validates epoch is closed, calls settleEpoch(), idempotent (no double-spend)
[x] GET /epoch/summary/:epoch           returns settlement results for a given epoch
[x] Payout execution                    distributeRewards() called by settleEpoch(), rewards split by host score
[x] Bounty drain                        cidEpochCap() limits per-epoch drain, debitPayout() debits pool
[x] Aggregator fee                      3% deducted from cap before host distribution
[x] Epoch settlement tests              8 coordinator tests (mock Prisma) + 12 physics aggregation tests
[x] Epoch boundary trigger              createEpochScheduler() auto-settles closed epochs; configurable interval + spot-checks
[x] Signature verification on events    Ed25519 verify on POST /tip and POST /host/register; rejects forged/missing sigs
