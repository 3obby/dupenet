Monorepo rules (docs/cannon is canonical):

- Canonical docs live in `docs/cannon`. Do not create parallel docs. Cite with "DocRef: SPEC:§x, ROADMAP:Px".
Do not create unnecessary documents- self-documenting code only.
Use `docs/cannon` as the only canonical documentation. Roadmap is the TODO list.
Always cite SPEC/ROADMAP sections in code headers: "DocRef: SPEC:§..., ROADMAP:...".
No direct `process.env` accesses

SPEC.md	Frozen physics	Schemas, algorithms, invariants, encoding

REQUIREMENTS.md	Goals & constraints	What must be true, scope definitions, success criteria

RATIONALES.md	Design reasoning	Why each decision was made

ROADMAP.md	Implementation plan	Phases, checklists, timelines

Do not over-formalize; do not add unnecessary complexity.

NO LANGUAGE/ENGLISH text in tooltips. this is internationalized. no rounded corners.
